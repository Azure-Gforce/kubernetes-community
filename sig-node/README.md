## Goals

Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Kubelet related features (e.g. Pod lifecycle)
* Node level performance and scalability (with [sig-scalability](../sig-scalability))
* Node reliability
* Node lifecycle management (with [sig-cluster-lifecycle](../sig-cluster-lifecycle))
* Container runtimes: docker, [rkt](../sig-rktnetes), etc.
* Images, package management
* Resource management (with [sig-scheduling](../sig-scheduling))
* Issues related to monitoring (with [sig-instrumentation](../sig-instrumentation))
* Node level security and Pod isolation (with [sig-auth](../sig-auth))
* Kernel interactions (to a limited extent)
* ...

We also work closely with [sig-storage](../sig-storage) and [sig-networking](../sig-networking). As you can see, this is a very cross-functional team!
