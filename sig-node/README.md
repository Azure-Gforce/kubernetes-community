# SIG Node

A Special Interest Group focused on topics related to the Kubernetes node, such as the Kubelet and
container runtime. It is an open and active community, and we always welcome new additions!

## Goals:

Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Kubelet related features (e.g. Pod lifecycle)
* Node level performance and scalability (with [sig-scalability](../sig-scalability))
* Node reliability
* Node lifecycle management (with [sig-cluster-lifecycle](../sig-cluster-lifecycle))
* Container runtimes: docker, [rkt](../sig-rktnetes), etc.
* Images, package management
* Resource management (with [sig-scheduling](../sig-scheduling))
* Issues related to monitoring (with [sig-instrumentation](../sig-instrumentation))
* Node level security and Pod isolation (with [sig-auth](../sig-auth))
* Kernel interactions (to a limited extent)
* ...

We also work closely with [sig-storage](../sig-storage) and [sig-networking](../sig-networking). As you can see, this is a very cross-functional team!
