# Nodeless Working Group

<!-- BEGIN CUSTOM CONTENT -->
The goals for the working group are as follows: 
Phase 1
1. Define what nodeless Kubernetes means to users, by exploring the realm of use cases 
2. Design a user experience around nodeless 
3. Create reference architectures for a nodeless Kubernetes and define clear behaviors for how a nodeless Kubernetes should act

Phase 2
4. Propose upstream API changes to make Kubernetes more extensible to containers as a service platforms
5. Define a clear list of limitations and user impact of nodeless from a userâ€™s point of view 
6. Propose conformance tests for nodeless kubernetes 
7. Define a standardized 'nodeless' API/capabilities that we expect nodeless container providers to implement for integration with Kubernetes
