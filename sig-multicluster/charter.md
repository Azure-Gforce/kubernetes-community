# SIG Multicluster Charter

This charter is a WIP.

SIG Multicluster focuses on solving common challenges related to:

- Managing/administering multiple Kubernetes clusters
- Deploying and managing applications into multiple Kubernetes clusters.

The SIG will be responsible for designing, discussing, implementing and
maintaining APIâ€™s, tools and documentation related to multicluster
administration and application management. This includes both active automated
approaches as well as batch workflow-style continuous deployment systems.
Standalone building blocks for these and other similar systems (for example a
cluster registry), and proposed changes to kubernetes core where appropriate
will also be in scope.
