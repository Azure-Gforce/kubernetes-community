# SIG Big Data Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance].

## Scope

The Big Data SIG serves as a community resource for advising big data and data science related software projects on techniques and best practices for integrating with Kubernetes. This SIG also represents the concerns of users from big data communities to Kubernetes for the purposes of driving new features and other enhancements, based on big data use cases.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services

- New features for supporting big data or data science use cases
- CRDs and Operators for big data tooling
- KEPs relating to either new features or new subprojects in support of big data

#### Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- Promoting best practices for Kubernetes integrations
- Advising big data communities on Kubernetes features
- Shepherding issues and pull requests from community members
- Hosting demos and discussions of big data integrations for Kubernetes

### Out of scope

- Promoting or otherwise advocating for any specfic big data project
- Software and tooling communities that have no intersection with data science or big data.

## Roles and Organization Management

This SIG adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance]
and opts-in to updates and modifications to [sig-governance].

### Additional responsibilities of Chairs

- Ensure that regular meetings have at least one SIG chair present, or that the meeting is canceled.
- Record meeting minutes
- Post teleconference recordings
- Represent the SIG at events and community meetings wherever possible
- Actively promote diversity and inclusion in the SIG
- Uphold the Kubernetes Code of Conduct especially in terms of personal behavior and responsibility

### Subproject Creation

Any subprojects that are deemed necessary to promote big data or data science use cases are to
be the responsibility of SIG Technical Leads, assembled for that purpose.

### To Do

- Whether or not to formalise a working definition of what conssitutes a big data or data science related project,
and if so how to codify that definition, remains an open question.
