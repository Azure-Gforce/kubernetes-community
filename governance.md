# Kubernetes SIG Governance

In order to standardize Special Interest Group efforts, create maximum transparency, and route contributors to the appropriate SIG, SIGs should follow the guidelines stated below:

* Meet regularly, at least for 30 minutes every 3 weeks, except November and December
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes, linked from the SIG's page in the community repo
* Announce meeting agenda and minutes after each meeting, on their SIG mailing list
* Record SIG meeting and make it publicly available
* Ensure the SIG's mailing list and slack channel are archived
* Report activity in the weekly community meeting at least once every 6 weeks
* Participate in release planning meetings and retrospectives, and burndown meetings, as needed
* Ensure related work happens in a project-owned github org and repository, with code and tests explicitly owned and supported by the SIG, including issue triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, etc.
