# 2022 Annual Report: SIG Security

## Current initiatives

**1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?**

- WIP
-
-

**2. What initiatives are you working on that aren't being tracked in KEPs?**

- WIP
-
-

**3. KEP work in 2022 (v1.24, v1.25, v1.26):**
- alpha:
  - [3203 - Auto-refreshing official CVE feed](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-security/3203-auto-refreshing-official-cve-feed) - v1.25

## Project health

**1. What areas and/or subprojects does your group need the most help with?**
- WIP

**Any areas with 2 or fewer OWNERs? (link to more details)**
- The nature of our work means we have little need for OWNERS files, compared to SIGs that ship a lot of code. We have two or more OWNERS in all areas, and our community focus helps ensure that when someone needs to scale back their involvement they will be well supported.

**2. What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?**
- We care about our people. We track community health by paying attention to community participation, and seeing how people are interacting. Are people coming to meetings and talking to one another on Slack? How many people are engaged? Is anyone dominating the conversation? Are new contributors becoming involved? Are people coming back?


  These types of concerns are notably hard to metricize, which we remain comfortable with.


  We continue to see both new and familiar faces in our meetings and slack channels. We continue to be a SIG that friends and colleagues encourage each other to make first and ongoing contributions with. We continue to hear comments like “my favorite group of people to work with”. Those things make us proud, and inspire us to keep going and improve.

**3. Does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] help **new** contributors engage with your group specifically by pointing
   to activities or programs that provide useful context or allow easy participation?**
- WIP

**4. If your group has special training, requirements for reviewers/approvers, or processes beyond the general [contributor guide],
   does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] document those to help **existing** contributors grow throughout the [contributor ladder]?**
- SIG Security does not have special training or requirements for reviewers/approvers. The nature of our cross-SIG work means that we have many fewer PRs, OWNERS files, and similar artifacts than many SIGs. The Kubernetes Contributor Ladder document as currently written focuses on scaling review of numerous code PRs. This limits its immediate applicability to our horizontal SIG, which owns very little code and is intentionally built upon open, non-hierarchical community participation.


  The upcoming formalization of the Subproject Lead role is well-aligned with the way we operate, and we look forward to seeing our Subproject Leads’ names in a YAML file of honor.

**5. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?**

- Yes

**6. Are there ways end users/companies can contribute that they currently are not?
   If one of those ways is more full time support, what would they work on and why?**
- WIP
