# Contributing to the Community Repo

Welcome to the Kubernetes Community contributing guide. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community)!

## Finding Something to Work On

Before you begin, you can look at some places where you can help out:

- [Existing open issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues)
- [Open Pull Requests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pulls) - Most of the pull requests in this repository are not code, but documentation and process. This is a great place to get started. Even if you do not have the rights to merge you can still help by doing a review.

## Steps

1. Make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (PR).
2. Upon successful review, someone will give the PR
a __LGTM__ (_looks good to me_) in the review thread.
3. A [SIG lead](sig-list.md) (or someone with approval powers
as specified in an OWNERS file) may merge the PR immediately
with or without an LGTM from someone else.
Or they may wait a business day to get further feedback from other reviewers.

### Trivial Edits

Each incoming Pull Request needs to be reviewed, checked, and then merged. 
While automation helps with this, each contribution also has an engineering cost. Therefore it is appreciated if you do NOT make trivial edits and fixes, but instead focus on giving the entire file a review.
If you find one grammatical or spelling error, it is likely there are more in that file, you can really make your Pull Request count by checking formatting, checking for broken links, and fixing errors and then submitting all the fixes at once to that file.
Some questions to consider:
- Can the file be improved further?
- Does the trivial edit greatly improve the quality of the content?

## Contributing to Individual SIGs

Each SIG may or may not have it's own policies for editing their section of this repository.

Edits in SIG sub-directories should follow any additional guidelines described
by the respective SIG leads in the sub-directory's `CONTRIBUTING` file
(e.g. [sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING](sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Attending a [SIG meeting](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md) or posting on their mailing list might be prudent if you want to make extensive contributions.
