# Contributing to the community repo


Contributions to this community repository follow a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (PR)
model:

#### 1. Submit a PR with your change

#### 2. Get an LGTM.

Upon successful review, someone will give the PR
a __LGTM__ (_looks good to me_) in the review thread.
   
#### 3. Allow time for others to see it

Once you have an __LGTM__, please wait 24 hours during
the week or 72 hours over a weekend before you
merge it, to give others (besides your initial reviewer) 
time to see it.

__That said, a [SIG lead](sig-list.md) may shortcut this by merging
someone else's change into their SIG's documentation
at any time.__

Edits in SIG sub-directories should follow structure and guidelines set
by the respective SIG leads - see `CONTRIBUTING` instructions in subdirectories.
