This is an announcement for the 2017 Kubernetes Leadership Summit, which will occur on June 2nd, 2017 in San Jose, CA. This event will be similar to the [Kubernetes Developer's Summit](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community/developer-summit-2016/Kubernetes_Dev_Summit.md) in November 2016, but involving a smaller smaller audience comprised solely of leaders and influencers of the community. These leaders and influences include the SIG leads, release managers, and representatives from several companies, including (but not limited to) Google, Red Hat, CoreOS, WeaveWorks, Deis, and Mirantis.

The summit will provide an avenue for leaders in the Kubernetes community to connect face to face and mindshare about future community development and community governance endeavors. 

This announcement serves to notify the broader community of the existence and goals of the event.

This is an **invite-only event**. All invitees will receive a direct invitation from Cameron (czahedi *at* google *dot* com).
