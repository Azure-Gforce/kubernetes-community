Here are the initial list of metrics that we propose:


*Distribution of contributor “age”: distribution of the period of time each contributor has been active in the community. If it it skews high, then we are not attracting and retaining many new contributors. If it skews low, then our community is experiencing a lot of burnout and we are not retaining our experienced contributors.

*# of ponies: the number of people who contribute 50% of the PRs This is an indication of how many individual contributors on which the community depends. This could also include a leaderboard with contributor names.

*# of new stars, watchers, forks of the kubernetes repo and number of new questions on stack overflow with respect to month: Indication of the visibility of the project. The example query is for stars over a short period of time, but the code would look similar for watchers and forks.

*# of PRs merged with respect to month: maybe broken down by SIG label and compared against PRs not sponsored by a SIG.

*Median PR latency: time from when a PR is opened to lgtm. This is an indication of whether the project has enough active reviewers to keep up and is also a measure of project velocity.
