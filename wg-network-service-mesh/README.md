# Network Service Mesh Working Group

A Working Group dedicated to discussing, designing and documenting Network Service Mesh.  Network Service Mesh is a novel approach to solving the more complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model by taking inspiration from the work in Istio Service Mesh and mapping them to L2/L3 payloads.
