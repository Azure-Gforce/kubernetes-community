* Completed [review of leading existing operators](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd-operator/blob/main/docs/wg/evaluation/evaluation.pdf)
* [Surveyed potential users](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd-operator/blob/main/docs/wg/survey/2024-operator-survey.md) and determined [operator development roadmap](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd-operator/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md)
