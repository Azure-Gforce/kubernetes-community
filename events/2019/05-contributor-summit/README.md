# 2019 Kubernetes Contributor Summit EU

## What

This event brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and collaborate face-to-face. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of the project, and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice. The summit spans two days - an optional social event in the evening of Sunday, May 19th along with the main full-day event on Monday, May 20th.

In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

 - Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
 - Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project
 - SIG-specific face-to-face collaboration

## New Contributor Workshops

The focus of the contributor summit in Barcelona is on new contributors. We have a large existing contributor base, especially in the US, and while we have a solid contingent in Europe, we would like to continue to grow our contributor presence in Europe to have a better balance across time zones and a more diverse set of contributors.

**Important**: The new contributor workshops are for people who are interested in **contributing** to Kubernetes, and **will not** include how to use / do k8s. The rest of KubeCon will have plenty of content about using k8s.

### The New Contributor Summit will have 2 tracks:

* 101 New Contributors: audience is brand new contributors who are interested in contributing, but have little to no experience contributing to open source projects.
* 201 Intermediate New Contributors: audience is people who have experience contributing to other open source projects, but who are new to contributing to k8s.

**Note**: Existing contributors should **not** register for either of these workshops, but you are welcome to attend the social event on Sunday, and you should talk to your SIG chairs to see if they plan to have a SIG F2F meeting on Monday.

### Key Facts:

* We are expecting 200 people with 100 of those attending the 101 New Contributor Workshop and 100 of those attending the 201 Intermediate New Contributor Workshop. 
* We have space for 140 people in room 4.1, and 100 people in room 5.1.
* Based on two previous event feedback, folks wanted the following: more hallway track/hang out time, more sessions with actionable items.

### Transparency:

* Recording: Record video, edit it into sections for easier consumption, and upload it to YouTube.
* Transcription: Create transcriptions to upload with the video.
* Content Sharing: Upload all presentations.

### New Contributor Workshop Outline:

Workshop Preparation: Clear communication on signing the CLA, and any preparatory downloads/installs for any content. Students will be given access to the slides in advance because there will be hands-on activities we want to avoid slow and error prone typing of links from a presentation being displayed on a screen.
