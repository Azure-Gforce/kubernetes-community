## SIGs
- CNCF Ambassador
- Cloudnative.tv host
- Sig contribex where I was part of bringing the APAC community.
- WG chaos engineering

## What I have done
I have been an active part of the Kubernetes community, using it heavily, at scale, as an end-user. I have represented the usage of Kubernetes and implemented it in various large-scale projects. 

I am passionate about helping others learn about Kubernetes and use my role as a CNCF Ambassador to reduce the Kubernetes learning curve. I teach Kubernetes and related technologies on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/saiyam911). I've been assisting new folks in starting their Kubernetes and cloud native journey and help them get started to contribute and build an APAC community (which does not exist today). I also run regular office hours to engage with folks. I also created the CNCFMinutes series. I pick one project from the CNCF landscape in each episode and talk through it in a few minutes. I also run a CNCF official show called - Cert Magic that helps folks prepare for Kubernetes certifications.)

From a working group standpoint, I am an active member of the chaos engineering WG where we are trying to establish a whitepaper. The need for chaos engineering is a must for cloud native applications and infrastructure, which leads to the need for goals and best practices that all chaos engineering projects should encompass so that users can benefit from identifying failures before they occur in production. I am also a part of SIG autoscaling, where I ran the machine learning platform that needs to scale on-demand and get the right metrics set. 

I work and contribute to the Kubernetes distributions, including K3s and K0s, by blogging, testing new features, and filing issues.



## What I'll do
Since I got involved, I have seen the project grow, and I have been actively using and contributing in different ways. I want to take my contributions to the next level and ensure that the project goes through the proper transitions to be more scalable, secure, and resilient over time. 

My goals are to increase the number of new contributors at different levels and build a more diverse and inclusive community where contributors feel empowered and find their voice quickly. I work with the CNCF students community, helping them get started with the technology, pointing them in the right direction for good first issues, and bringing more contributors to the Kubernetes community.
 
I will continue to advocate for K8s in my existing avenues (meetups, YouTube, blogging, talks) and emphasize helping our new contributors build "a better Kubernetes." 

I will be bringing my Kubernetes at scale experience to help in the aspects like autoscaling, auditing, and metrics that will help the project be more resilient and scalable.

I have been part of this fantastic community and used it in different roles in my career. As part of the steering committee, I would be ecstatic to contribute to the project that has made my career successful. I want to give back to the community to help best- growing the community, making the project more resilient, and allowing it to scale even better.
