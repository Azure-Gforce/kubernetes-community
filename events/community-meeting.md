# Kubernetes Monthly Community Meeting

We have PUBLIC and RECORDED [monthly meeting][community-meeting] the third
Thursday of the month at [10am PT]; with the exception of December, or in the
event it clashes with KubeCon + CloudNativeCon.
 
See it on the web at [calendar.google.com], or paste this [iCal url] into any
[iCal client]. Do NOT copy the meetings over to your personal calendar; you will
miss meeting updates. Instead use your client's calendaring feature to say you
are attending the meeting so that any changes made to meetings will be reflected
on your personal calendar. Note that meeting invites are sent to the Kuberentes
contributor mailing list (k-dev).

All meetings are archived on the [YouTube Channel].

## Purpose

The Kubernetes community meeting is intended to provide a contributor-wide forum
for discussion of various community activities, critical release information, 
Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs), and governance updates. The focus of
discussion is on project-level concerns that might need a wider audience than a
single special interest group (SIG).

## Notes

Notes from the meeting are published to [this forum thread] for wider
distribution. We are always asking for help with notes; if you would like to
volunteer, please check out the [Volunteers](#volunteers) section.

## Meeting Agenda

If you have a topic you'd like to present or would like to see discussed,
please propose that topic by any of the following methods:
* Fill out [this form].
* Tag the coordinator in a GitHub issue and request to add the topic to the
  agenda.
* Message the coordinator to request to add a topic either on Slack or via
  email.

The [Kubernetes Community Meeting Agenda][agenda] will be updated by the day of
the call with the full list of topics. Generally speaking, the meeting is
structured as follows:

- Introduction by Host (~3 minutes)
- Announcements
  - Any community announcements that are not discussion topics should go here
- Release Updates (~10 minutes, Optional, release manager's discretion)
  - Development Release
  - Stable Release and point releases
  - Older stable releases and point releases
- Topics for discussion
- KEP Callouts
- Shoutouts, an aggregation of thanks from community members to other
  contributors via the `#shoutouts` channel 

## Topics for Discussion

Contributors can suggest topics for discussion via the following methods:
* Fill out [this form].
* Tag the coordinator in a GitHub issue and request to add the topic to the
  agenda.
* Message the coordinator to request to add a topic either on Slack or via
  email.

Any topic should include a person to start the conversation or provide further
context. Examples for such topics include the following ideas:

- Decisions where input is being sought from other SIGs
- Topics that could affect other SIGs
- Discussions around getting contributions for a particular project

## KEP Callouts

If a KEP has a significant impact to other SIGs or the project as a whole, or
if the people behind a KEP would like to have more discussion with the rest of
the contributors group about that KEP, add the KEP to the agenda so we can
discuss it.

## A Word on Demos

If a discussion or a KEP requires demoing a specific feature or functionality
for the group, please remember this meeting has a large number of attendees.
Out of respect for their time, we ask that you be fully prepared for your demo.
Make sure slides are clear if applicable, and the link to them is posted in the
meeting agenda. Also, if you are doing a live coding demo, please make sure it
has a reasonable chance of completing within the allotted time box.

- Demos must be about a core component of Kubernetes or a related project that
  is owned by a SIG. For projects in the Kubernetes ecosystem, you can sign up
  for a [CNCF Webinar].
- You are required to show up 10 minutes before the meeting to verify your audio
  and screensharing capabilities with the hosts. If you cannot make and keep
  this commitment, you will not be allowed to proceed with your demo until such
  time you can.
- The use of a headset or other high-quality audio equipment is strongly
  encouraged. Typing on a laptop while using the system microphone is
  distracting, so please insulate your microphone from key noises.
- Ensure you are presenting from a quiet environment.
- If you run out of time while performing your demo, you may ask the audience
  if they would like a follow-up at a subsequent meeting. If there is
  enthusiastic support, the community team will help schedule a continuation.


## Archives

The document gets slow as we add notes, so it is archived regularly into the
[Meeting Notes Archive].

## Volunteers
We are always open to new volunteers with the community meeting. For more
information on the various roles, explore [the roles handbook] and reach out to
the coordinator to sign up.
