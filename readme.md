# Kubernetes

Welcome to the Kubernetes repository!

## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for running applications in containers, making it easier to manage and scale complex distributed systems.

This repository serves as a central hub for Kubernetes-related resources, including documentation, code, and community contributions.
