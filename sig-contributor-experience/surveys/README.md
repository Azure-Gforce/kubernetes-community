This directory contains the analysis of surveys given to the contributor community. Each indidivual survey's data and corresponding anaylss are found in the directory named after the corresponding year. The README.md in those directories contains the full analysis done. For space resaons, the notebooks from which the README.md files are dervived have been cleared of output. 

In addition to the induvidual year analysis, multi-year comparisons can be found in `multi_year_comparisons`.

To run the notebooks on your own, the following packages are required:

* pandas
* plotnine
* numpy
