# Elders Council :
This group acts in the service of the community and the project to provide clear decisions and direction for the community when it is unable to independently make a decision.  Whereas most of the component level technical decisions happen in Special Interest Groups (SIGs), the Elders are expected to steward a broader Kubernetes Project vision through clear resolutions in situations like multiple SIGs having conflicting views or larger community discussions which donâ€™t have clear outcomes. Additional examples are cited comments in the [initial community discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/28).

# Escalation:
Publishing a process to escalate to the Elders will be one of the first tasks of the group in conjunction with a Kubernetes community manager (currently Sarah Novotny).  A recommended process is an Elders escalation mailing list where discussions can happen between representatives of opposing positions on an issue.  Decisions documented in kubernetes/community and a summary mail to Kubernetes-dev@ mailing list.

# Status:
This process is light on legalese, completely untested, and only works if people act as good neighbors and community members. It will evolve over time and the authors will try keeping the process light, fast, and objective.

# Requirements:
Members of group will be active and have leadership positions in the community; a long standing history with and future commitment to this project in addition to experience in large, long-lived software projects.  Key to success will be people management skills, strong technical vision for the project and empathy for the user and FOSS developer perspective. 

# Instantiation:
The first seed incarnation of the Elders will be voted in as a slate of 3 Elders with a 2 year term (ending January 2019) through the Community Meeting and on the mailing list kubernetes-dev@.  During the first year, the Elders may add 2 members (with a term ending January 2018) to their group for a total of 5 members. In the event of a Elder's employment changing companies, the position remains with the individual.

# Refreshes:
In August each year subsequent the community will vote on the seats which term out.  All positions voted on will have a 2 year term.  The voting will be handled using Condorcet voting and a service such as CIVS.  The vote will not be public, but will require standing as an Active Contributor as defined in the [Community Governance documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md).  Nominations for candidates will be accepted for one week prior to the voting period. Incumbents will be automatically nominated unless they opt-out of reelection. Any newly elected member should not increase representation on the board above 2 people per company. In the case where this invariant would be violated, the candidate(s) with the next highest number of votes will be elected.

# Resignations:
In the event that an elder resigns, the remaining elders will appoint a successor to serve until the next scheduled vote for that seat. Appointments are held to the same per company representation standards as newly elected elders.
