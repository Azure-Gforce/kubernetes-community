# Usability Special Interest Group

The scope of SIG usability is the core end-user usability of the Kubernetes project. This covers topics like user experience and accessibility. The goals of the SIG are to ensure that the Kubernetes project is maximally usable by users of a variety of different backgrounds and abilities. Examples of efforts include internationalization and accessibility of documentation.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Usability Special Interest Group.
