  Overview of community property moderator roles, responsibilities, selection,
  and best practices.
---

This page describes the rules and best practices for people chosen to moderate
Kubernetes communications channels. This includes Github, Slack, forums, mailing
lists, YouTube, Zoom, and any property listed in the SIG Contributor Experience
[charter][].

-   Check the [centralized list of administrators][moderators] for contact information.
-   Some Kubernetes properties, like the Twitter account, are managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][].

## Selection of Moderators

Each Kubernetes property has a certain set of
[moderators][] who are responsible for keeping
it safe and a fun place to participate. Properties include, but are not limited
to, shared community spaces like Slack, YouTube, etc.

Moderators are selected by following the criteria:

Moderators *MUST*:

-   Be a [member of the Kubernetes Organization][].
-   Have experience moderating something or some equivalent level of community
    management.
-   Make themselves available during their primary working hours for their given
    timezone.
-   Communicate their availability to their peer moderators when appropriate,
    such as when traveling or becoming unavailable for an extended period of
    time.
-   Understand that volunteering for this role might mean an occasional personal
    time commitment or off-hour duty.

The process for applying for moderatorship is as follows:

-   Sponsored by 2 existing moderators **Note the following requirements for
    sponsors**:
    -   Sponsors MUST have close interactions with the prospective member -
        example: participating in the appropriate property, coordinating on
        issues, etc.
    -   Sponsors MUST be from multiple member companies to demonstrate
        integration across the community.
    -   Sponsors MUST take time zone coverage into account, each property should
        have global coverage. Ideally no more than two(2) moderators are
        needed in a given time zone.
    -   Sponsors MUST ensure that nominees are familiar with the software they
        are using to moderate.
-   **[Open an issue][] against the kubernetes/community repo**
    -   Ensure your sponsors are @mentioned on the issue using their primary
        username.
    -   Complete every item on the checklist
    -   Make sure that the list of contributions included is representative of
        your work on the project.
-   Have your sponsoring reviewers reply with confirmation of sponsorship, which
    is denoted by a +1 or similar approval.

### Moderators Pro Tempore

Each property will have a list of moderators who cannot commit to full time
moderatorship, but are available during special events or circumstances that
might call for additional ad-hoc duties.

For example if all moderators are attending a conference, pro tempore moderators
may be assigned to monitor a property.

## Rotation of Moderators

Content moderation can be personally tiring, so primary Moderators *SHOULD*
rotate on a regular basis.

-   Primary moderators should evaluate their position(s) as a team *yearly*.
    -   Determine whether the moderation situation on the property is working.
    -   Rotate teams accordingly.
    -   Consider rotating in a less experienced person to give them an
        opportunity to participate.
    -   Take into account time zone considerations.
-   Due to less workload Moderators Pro Tempore should be a lightweight role
    -   Primary moderators should consider switching to this role for a given
        amount of time to allow for a healthy rotation.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of
the Kubernetes community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your
contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all Kubernetes
official channels.

Moderators *MUST*:

-   Take action as specified by these Kubernetes Moderator Guidelines.
    -   You are empowered to take *immediate action* when there is a violation.
        You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious
        violation has occurred. Make a judgment call based on our [Code of Conduct][] and Values (see below).
    -   Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let
        it sit there.
-   Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators.
-   Ensure that the Kubernetes [Code of Conduct][] is in effect on all official
    Kubernetes communication channels.
-   Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for
    moderation.
    -   This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of
        people to allow for absences/travel.
    -   Ensure you are on #slack-admins during work hours and notifications are
        set appropriately.
-   Become familiar with the [Kubernetes Community Values][].
-   Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by
    removing a member from that resource.
-   Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential
    multiple cultural differences between Kubernetes community members.
-   Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers,
    and other users via private email or a direct message.
-   Keep up with software/platform changes on the property they are responsible
    for. This might include new UI changes, new features, or other software
    changes. Moderators are encouraged to meet regularly to train themselves
    how to be proficient with the platform.
-   Report violations of the Code of Conduct to conduct@kubernetes.io.

Moderators *SHOULD*:

-   Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with
    other community members.
-   Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having
    difficulty expressing comments and questions in English.
-   Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases,
    moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact
    with.
-   Remember to check and recognize if you need to take a break when you become
    frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate.
-   Help your colleagues if you recognize them in one of the 
    [stages of burnout][].
-   Be helpful and have fun!

## Violations

The Kubernetes [Code of Conduct Committee][] will have the final authority
regarding escalated moderation matters. Violations of the Code of Conduct will
be handled on a case by case basis. Depending on severity, this can range up to
and including removal of the person from the community, though this is extremely
rare. This decision comes from the Code of Conduct committee, not the
moderators.

## Escalation Procedures

In the event of large attacks the moderator team must enact the following
procedures:

-   The person on call should immediately concentrate on removing the offending
    content and asking for other on-call moderators for help. That is their
    sole responsibility.
-   The secondary person on call should immediately begin to take notes to
    document the incident, this will form the basis of a post-mortem. The 2nd
    person on site is responsible for finding help, and documenting the
    incident.
-   The secondary person on call will escalate if necessary. If it's a one off
    incident and the content is removed, then the collective moderators can
    work on a post-mortem and report the incident to primary moderators within
    24 hours.
    -   If it's a sustained incident that needs more help, the secondary will
        contact other primary moderators as soon as possible.
    -   If appropriate, the next level of people to contact are the OWNERS of
        the subproject.
    -   If appropriate, the next level of people to contact is the 
        [Code of Conduct Committee][].
    -   If appropriate, the next level of people to contact is the 
        [Steering Committee][].
-   Moderators will have access to a private document with contact information
    of the appropriate people.
-   Primary moderators will then execute an audit of the affected property:
    -   Slack: emoji audit
    -   (More per-property steps to be added as we learn them)

### Process for Adding a Moderator

This is the workflow for adding a moderator.

-   Moderator applies by [filing an issue][] in the kubernetes/community repo
-   Moderator gets approval from 2 current moderators
-   Add the person to their respective moderation tool:
    -   Slack - Add them as a slack workspace admins (instructions pinned on
        #slack-admins-private): Invite them to #slack-admins-private,
        #slack-admins, #slack-log, #slack-reports and #slack-invites
    -   Discuss - Change their permission to moderator
    -   Kubernetes.io Google group - PR the person into the correct yaml file in
        [kubernetes/k8s.io][]. (Note: This only applies to groups using
        @kubernetes.io, most other lists are still managed out of band)
    -   Ensure they add that they are an admin in their profile page on whatever
        service they are administrating
-   Add them to the moderators mailing list by PRing them into the
    [moderators@kubernetes.io group][] linking to the person's moderator
    github application as part of the PR.
-   Ensure the person is enrolled for a future bias training course; this can
    either be provided by the project or their employer.
