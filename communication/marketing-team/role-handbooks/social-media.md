# Social Media Handbook

## Overview

Social Media leads and members help contribute to the Marketing Team's efforts to communicate with contributors on a broad scale through social media.  At time of writing, the primary social media channel we communicate through is the [@K8sContributors handle on twitter](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors).

Any contributor can help write tweets to be distributed through the twitter handle by utilizing the [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets). This repo utilizes the open source [twitter-together](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together) project to automate taking PRs to the repo, and distributing them as tweets from the @K8sContributor handle.


## Minimum Skills and Requirements

- Are a member of the [Kubernetes GitHub Org]
- Familiar with twitter by either having a personal account or managing another account (brand, oss project, employer, local nonprofit, etc)

### Expected Time Investment

Team members: 1-3 hours a week.
Team leads: 3-5 hours per week.

## General Expectations

- Most of this information can be found in our [social guidelines]
- Be welcoming, be yourself

The leader(s) of the social media team will be expected to monitor the @K8sContributors handle. Retweets, replies, and responding to replies appropriately fall under the purview of the social media lead. Time-sensitive tweets should also be handled directly by the team lead. Team leads should coordinate with team members to plan tweets in advance, particularly for large contributor-focused events such as KubeCon or Contributor Summit.

Team members will be expected to help keep an eye out for news in need of tweeting. Common sources of such announcements are the k-dev mailing list and the #contributor-comms channel on Slack. Team members can submit less time-sensitive tweets to the [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets) for review and tweeting.
