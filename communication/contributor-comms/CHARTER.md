# Contributor Comms Subproject Lead Role Handbook

## Overview

This handbook outlines expectations and responsibilities for Kubernetes Contributor Communications Subproject Leads as well as Contributor Comms team members who wish to lead the subproject's efforts.

Contributor Communications Subproject Leads are responsible for a number of tasks that are delegated to the team from SIG Contributor Experience, this includes:

* Running Subproject Meetings
* Representing Subproject to SIG-ContribEx leadership
  * SIG meetings
* Managing ownership of subproject repos (such as [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets))
* Ensuring that role handbooks are created, updated, used, and deprecated as needed
* Managing the Contributor Comms teamâ€™s Slack presence
  * Alias
  * Channel
  * Team
* Acquiring funds from Kubernetes Steering Committee
* Managing the lifecycle process of requests and issues for the Contributor Communications Subproject
* Handling emergency communications (passing of a community member, highly sensitive topics like dockershim, etc.)

## **Minimum Skills and Requirements**

A subproject lead should be:

* A member of the [Kubernetes GitHub Org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org)
* Available to attend/lead regular Contributor Comms meetings and collaborate asynchronously via the #sig-contribex-comms channel in the Kubernetes Slack
* Able and willing to actively recruit members and shadows for the benefit of the entire team and the contributor
* [Preferred] Familiar with managing a social media presence by either having personal accounts or managing another account (brand, OSS project, employer, local nonprofit, etc)

### Expected Time Investment

Team leads: 3-5 hours per week. Team members: 1-3 hours per week.

## General Expectations

* Report the subproject status at events and community meetings wherever possible
* Actively promote diversity and inclusion in the SIG
* Uphold the Kubernetes Code of Conduct especially in terms of personal behavior and responsibility
* Chairs oversee the subproject creation process
* Be welcoming, be yourself
* Understanding, communicating, and setting/adjusting [social guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/contributor-comms/storytelling-resources/social-guidelines.md)
* Coordinating work to create tweets, ensuring tweet requests are fulfilled
* Working with other Contributor Comms leads, such as the Event Coordinator Lead, on social media tasks
* Approving tweet PRs on [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets)
* Training new leads

The leader(s) of the social media team will be expected to monitor the @K8sContributors handle. Retweets, replies, and responding to replies appropriately fall under the purview of the social media lead. Time-sensitive tweets should also be handled directly by the team lead. Team leads should coordinate with team members to plan tweets in advance, particularly for large contributor-focused events such as KubeCon or Contributor Summit.

Team members will be expected to keep an eye out for news in need of tweeting. Common sources of such announcements are the k-dev mailing list and the #contributor-comms channel on Slack. Team members can submit less time-sensitive tweets to the [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets) for review and tweeting.

## Associates Overview (Shadow)

Team members who wish to become subproject leads should express this desire to the current lead(s). Leads should work with shadows to understand their capacity to take on the needs of the lead role and work with the shadow on a plan for them to take on responsibility including:

* Becoming an owner (approver privileges) on the [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets) repo
* Watching for new tweet PRs and working with PR creators on scheduling/approving tweets
* Watching for new tweet requests and ensuring they get assigned to team members or created directly
* Taking on direct Twitter management
