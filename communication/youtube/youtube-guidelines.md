## Code of Conduct

Kubernetes adheres to the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct][coc] throughout the
project, and includes all communication mediums.


## Admins

- Check the [centralized list of administrators] for contact information.


## Meeting Playlists

The [Kubernetes YouTube Channel] has separate playlists for each SIG, WG, UG
meeting recordings, as well as recordings of other recurring events such as the
Kubernetes [Community meeting], [Office Hours], [Meet our Contributors] and
others.

To better serve the community, [collaboration] has been enabled to share the
management of the playlists. Anyone with the appropriate link to the particular
playlist can upload videos _to that particular playlist_ (links & playlists are
one-to-one).

Each group's playlist link will be shared with the group's leadership via Slack
and the group leadership Google Group. Other playlists links, for example Office Hours, will be shared with the appropriate point(s) of contact.


### Uploading Guidelines for Collaborators

**NOTE:** If you're using a G Suite account you may need to [loosen the
permissions in your YouTube settings]. If you have any questions reach out to
the [YouTube admins] or [SIG Contributor Experience].

With collaboration comes great responsibility. Playlist collaborators in the
community must use it responsibly and are subject to the following guidelines:

- Group leaders or other appropriate point(s) of contact are the primary
  managers for the playlist, once collaboration is configured. YouTube admins
  should **only** be contacted if the issue cannot be resolved by one of the
  playlist owners.

- Upload responsibilities belong to the group leaders or other appropriate
  point(s) of contact. YouTube admins should **only** be contacted if the
  issue cannot be resolved by the playlist owners.

- Please post only related content; for example: meeting recordings, in the
  appropriate playlists.
  - Posting of any exceedingly inappropriate content (i.e. NSFW content) will
	result in ***immediate*** suspension of privileges.

- All posted videos should use the naming convention:
  `Kubernetes [Name of Playlist’s Group] YYYYMMDD`
  - **Example:** `Kubernetes SIG Service Catalog 20161129`

- Playlists should be organized chronologically for ease of use. This can be
  done by updating the default ordering of the Playlist:
  - From within the Playlist settings, click on the **Basic** Tab.
  - From the **Ordering** dropdown select "Date added (newest)".
  - Save the changes and the order should automatically be updated.

- Please do not remove any already-published content from the playlists without
  checking with the YouTube admins.

- For any small issues that arise, for example improper naming or ordering, you
  may be asked by the YouTube admins to attempt to resolve the issue yourself.

- Any egregious or habitual violations (3 or more per quarter) of the above
  rules will result in suspension of collaboration privileges for the particular
  individual or for the entire playlist if the individual can’t be identified.
  - If an individual is suspended, the playlist link will be remade and the new
    link will be shared with the non-offending individuals.
  - If playlist collaboration is suspended, the uploading and management of
    the playlist will be handled by the YouTube admins. Uploading the
	problematic group's playlist will not be considered a priority, and delays
	in uploading should be expected.


## Admin Responsibilities

### Moderator Expectations and Guidelines

Moderators should adhere to the general Kubernetes project
[moderation guidelines].

Moderation responsibilities for YouTube admins is minimal and is centered around
checking and removing any potential comments that would violate the [Code of
Conduct][coc]. Any potential violations should sent to <conduct@kubernetes.io>.


### Trimming and Editing Recordings

YouTube admins may be asked to help [trim] and [edit] recordings. Certain events
such as the Contributor Summits are not uploaded directly to YouTube and require
editing. In other instances a Zoom recording may have significant dead-space
leading the meeting itself. In these instances the playlist owners may be asked
first to trim a recording; however there are times where this is inopportune and
an admin may step in.


### Streaming Events

YouTube admins with a system capable of streaming may be asked to stream public
Kubernetes Community events such as the weekly [Community Meeting],
[Office Hours], [Meet our Contributors], or other publicly streamed events.
