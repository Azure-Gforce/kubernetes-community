## Kubernetes PM

Kubernetes PM special interest group (SIG-PM) is a group within the Kubernetes Community, that is responsible for managing and maintaining the project roadmap and direction through ways other than writing code. 

It has been established from the PM Working Group, following the same goals, principles, and statements; with regards to the [Kubernetes SIG general requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md#sig-governance). 

The primary goal of the PM group is Product Management (PdM), considering Kubernetes as a product. Also, SIG PM covers the areas of Project Management (PjM) and Program Management (PgM) of Kubernetes.

### Responsibilities
