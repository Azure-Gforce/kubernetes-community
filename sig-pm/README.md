## The Kubernetes PM Group

### Focus

The Kubernetes PM Group is focused on a variety of challenges: from the qualification and successful management of user requests, one of the many tasks of product management, through the continued improvement of the processes used by the Kubernetes community to maintain the Kubernetes Project itself which more closely relates to traditional project or program management. Besides helping to discover both what to build and how to build it, the PM Group also helps to try and keep the wheels on this spaceship we are all building together; bringing together people who think about Kubernetes as both a vibrant community of humans and technical program is another primary focus of this group. Members of the Kubernetes PM Group can assume [certain additional](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/project-managers/README.md) responsibilities to help maintain the Kubernetes Project itself. It is also important to remember that the role of managing an open source project is very new and largely unscoped for a project as large as Kubernetes; we are learning too and we are excited to learn how we can best serve the community of users and contributors.
