# Kubernetes Community Group Annual Reports

This document outlines the process for an annual reporting and
communication structure for Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Working Groups (WGs),
User Groups (UGs), and Committees.
All policy updates will be in their respective [SIG], [WG], and [UG]
 governance docs as well as the general [governance] guidance.

## Goals
- Paint a complete project health picture for all of our community groups
- Create a feedback loop between Chairs, Tech Leads, Subproject Owners, WG and
UG Organizers, the community groups at large, and the Steering
Committee to move the project forward  
- Encourage dialogue about the wellbeing of the projects contributors and offer
suggested guidance and coaching
- Promote healthy, active, engaged community groups  
- Understand and have context before issues arise and celebrate wins where they  
should be highlighted  
- Help reshape project priorities at a high level

## Reporting Process  

Chairs and Organizers are responsible for compiling a yearly public report but
may be completed with the help of members of that group. Groups are encouraged
to make this an agenda item of topic to discuss together. Chairs and Organizers
ensure that reports are complete, accurate, and submitted to the Steering
Committee.

1. Early January (of the following year)
   * Steering Committee finalizes [questions] and generates draft 
     `annual-report-YYYY.md` templates for each group in the community repo
   * Steering Committee liaison reaches out to group leads to kick off
2. January-February
   * Chairs/Organizers work with their group (see tips below) to open
     a pull request to the group's documentation in the community repo,
     updating the draft to complete the questions
   * post a call for comments period on the PR with your group's mailing list;
     you can follow your charter communication period if you have one,
     but no less than 72 hours
   * verify that Steering Liaison has reviewed
   * merge a completed report by the end of February
3. March
   * Steering Committee produces a project-wide annual report,
     summarizing and highlighting elements from the individual group reports.
   * The Steering Committee liaison will work directly with groups that have 
     follow up items and update Steering during regular monthly meetings. The liaison
     will also coordinate time with the Chairs (as a group). If you'd like to meet 
     1:1 instead, please let your liaison know.
   * The March edition of the "Chairs, Tech Leads, and Organizers" meetings will 
     be used as follow up for the community groups that have questions from/to 
     Steering and a retrospective

### Tips for Chairs and Working Group Organizers:      
- Work together with your groups roles and community members to complete;
suggestion: schedule a dedicated meeting or intentional agenda item to go over 
project health with the goal of compiling this report, delegate to subproject
owners or other community members
- All questions require a response. 
- End users and other members of the community will read these. Err on the side
of being more explicit than using our upstream shorthand or abbreviations. 
- The [questions] can be forked into whatever medium you wish to
collaborate with your community: gdocs, hackmd, etc - it will all land back into
a pull request at the end. 

## Questions for report: {#questions}

#### Special Interest Groups:
##### Operational 
- How are you doing with operational tasks in [SIG]-governance.md?
  - Is your README accurate? have a CONTRIBUTING.md file?
  - All subprojects correctly mapped and listed in sigs.yaml?
  - What’s your meeting culture? Large/small, active/quiet, learnings? Meeting 
  notes up to date? Are you keeping recordings up to date/trends in community 
  members watching recordings?
- How does the group get updates, reports, or feedback from subprojects? Are 
there any springing up or being retired? Are OWNERS.md files up to date in these
 areas?
- Same question as above but for working groups.
- When was your last public community-wide update? (provide link to deck and/or
 recording)

##### Membership
- Are all listed SIG leaders (chairs, tech leads, and subproject owners) active?
- How do you measure membership? By mailing list members, OWNERs, or something
else?
- How does the group measure reviewer and approver bandwidth? Do you need help
in any area now? What are you doing about it?
- Is there a healthy onboarding and growth path for contributors in your SIG?
What are some activities that the group does to encourage this? What programs
are you participating in to grow contributors throughout the contributor ladder?
- What programs do you participate in for new contributors?
- Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations? Can end
 users/companies contribute in some way that they currently are not?

##### Current initiatives and project health
- What are initiatives that should be highlighted, lauded, shout outs, that
your group is proud of? Currently underway? What are some of the longer tail
projects that your group is working on?
- Year to date KEP work: What's now stable? Beta? Alpha? Road to alpha?
- What initiatives are you working on that aren't being tracked in KEPs?
- What areas and/or subprojects does the group need the most help with?
- What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?
Examples?     

### Working Groups:
Working Group Organizers are responsible for submitting this report but may
delegate to members to curate  
- What was the initial mission of the group and if it's changed, how?
- What’s the current roadmap until completion?
- Have you produced any artifacts, reports, white papers to date?
- Is the group active? healthy? contributors from multiple companies and/or end
user companies?
- Is everything in your readme accurate? posting meetings on youtube?
- Do you have regular check-ins with your sponsoring SIGs?
