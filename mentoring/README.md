This folder will be used for all mentoring initiatives for Kubernetes.

We understand that everyone has different learning styles and we want to support as many of those as possible. Mentoring is vital to the growth of an individual and organization of every kind.

Current mentoring activities:  
[Contributor Office Hours](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community/office-hours.md)  
Group Mentoring Cohorts  
[Outreachy](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cli/outreachy.md)

All are currently in an incubation phase. Please reach out to Paris Pittman (parispittman@google.com or k8s slack) for more information on how to get involved. The preliminary deck for mentoring strategies is here.
