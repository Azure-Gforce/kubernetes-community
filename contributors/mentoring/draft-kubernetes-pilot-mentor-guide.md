## What is this document about

This document is a guide for Mentors involved in the Kubernetes Pilot Program.

> Mentoring is to support and encourage people to manage their own learning so
that they may maximise their potential, develop their skills, improve their
performance and become the person they want to be.

- Eric Parsloe, The Oxford School of Coaching & Mentoring

Mentoring is not coaching, but leading and encouraging people to reach their
potential.  Mentee’s must be asked to take responsibility for their growth and
improvement.  Only through change and learning can people grow, and often change
is quite painful.  Mentors walk alongside the Mentee in their journey, and build
confidence and encourage.

Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie in her novel, Mrs. Dymond talked about how to
teach and mentor.  Rephasing her writing to the context of Mentoring; if we
continuously answer a Mentee’s questions, and give them answers, we are limiting
their growth.  If we teach them to find the answers and teach them how to
contribute to Kubernetes, we help the Mentee become a lifetime Open Source
Contributor.

The Mentor’s role is to teach Mentees’ how to contribute to the Kubernetes
community.  As mentors, we incline to give the people answers and direction, but
it is more critical to build productive contributors to our community.

## Benefits of Being a Mentor

Being mentor typically forces personal growth for not only the Mentee but also
the Mentor.  Often a Mentor’s leadership and communications skills are improved.
A Mentor is given back to the Kubernetes Community as a whole and helps improve
the organization’s culture direction.  It often helps our perspective, as we can
view the community through the eyes of a newcomer, which differs far from our
current perspective.  Mentor learn about people; how they learn, how they
communicate, and how they think.  This knowledge can always help in a Mentor’s
personal development.  The mention of being involved with this program can only
support one’s career path.

It is good to pay it forward.  The rewards and benefits of serving as a Mentor
cannot be qualified.  Mentoring helps provide quality fast-tracked learning
through being a positive example to experienced contributors and helps them
grow. You can set the stage instead of trial by error.

## How is a Mentor Successful

Success criteria is quite difficult to measure or quantify.  Even if a Mentee
chooses to leave the program, interaction with a Mentor can impact their lives
immensely.  A Mentor’s success cannot be solely judged upon the success of the
Mentee, but we must always want to improve and determine what we can change when
a Mentee fails or drops out.

Measure forward momentum and progress is one way to gauge the success of a
Mentor and Mentee.  Part of this program will include guidelines for both
Mentees and Mentors to set goals with measurable results.

### Mentors Growth

Personal growth, and becoming a better Mentor, is how you define success as a
Mentor.  Measuring personal growth and progress is subjective analytics.  It is
not a hard science, but more an art form.  Three components can assist measure
progress; goals, feedback, and mentorship. Five to ten percent of people have
written goals.  To measure any target, it must be written down and tracked.
Write down your goals, and specifically for Pilots write down your goals that
apply to improving as a mentor.  Be open to the feedback loops that are
established for this program.  As people with egos, we often say: “Yes I am open
to feedback.”  But as a mentor, we need to leave our ego at the door, and listen
and apply feedback to our lives.  As a mentor, you will be paired with someone
in the community who is mentoring the mentors.

To recap; goals, feedback, and mentorship.

## Mentor Conduct

### Communication

How we act, carry ourselves, and approach people is critical as Mentors.
Communication is a  key component of successful conduct as a mentor.
Interrupting and not listening the people that we are communicating with are key
factors that allow communication to fail.  Allow people to finish their
statements, don’t interrupt.  Not interrupting may seem a simple habit to
acquire, but again it is an art form.  If you have a habit of interrupting those
you interact with, take a beat, start talking when a person is done with there
communication.

Once a person has completed what they have said, our job is then to understand
what they said.  We are all different people, with diverse backgrounds, often
from different countries, and cultures.  We may have heard the words that a
person related, but 80% of communication is nonverbal, and the words of one
person, may not the words of another.  Ask clarifying questions during the
conversation.  Put in your own words, what the other person has said.  Expect
that people do not communicate in the same manner that you express. The majority
of the time, miscommunication is complete without malice, and unintentional.
Assume that people are trying to communicate positively.

Over-communicate without interrupting people.  Do not over-communicate to the
point of annoyance.  If a topic with a mentee is essential, the mentee or mentor
should send a follow-up email or slack message.  Communicate ahead of time with
any changes to previously set assumptions.  Meeting time changes, or timelines
on any tasks must be communicated quickly and ahead of time.  Take written
notes, and document timelines and dates.  If it was not written down, it did not
happen.  Use video conferences as much as possible. As mentioned, eighty percent
of communication is nonverbal.  Experts debate the exact number, but the
majority of them agree that vocal tone and body language are more important than
the words we speak.  The written prose is incredible but often misinterpreted.
Audio communication is better, as we can hear the vocal tone of fellow speakers.
Video improves meetings even more, but face to face is the best.  Face to face
mentorship and interaction is the best, but often not practical within our
community.

### Code of Conduct

What mentors do, mentees will model.  A mentee's Kubernetes Kung-Fu is only 80%
as good as mentors.  A student's kick is often just 80% as good as an
instructor's kick.  The student can surpass the master, and we hope that they
do.  But a mentors conduct is paramount for the success of the mentor and
mentee. What mentors do mentee will do, and because of this mentors behavior is
critical.

From our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

>  As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities. We are
committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size,
race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Read it. Live it within the Kubernetes Community. Respect peers, mentees, and
other members.  Display respect through communication, and all interaction.
What we say and communicate is the rudder. It may seem small, but a rudder can
influence the course of a several ton vessel.

## Successful Interaction with Mentees

It is all of our desire to have fruitful interaction with mentees as mentors.
The following tools improve mentor/mentee relationships.

### Patience

A mentor must be patient with a mentee.  Through repetition, people learn, and
as a mentor, we cannot expect a mentee to meet our expectations.  Through the
removal of expectation and bias, with a sprinkle of compassion, we can gain more
patience.

### Communication

Exceptional communication is what we strive for as mentors.  See above for more
details.

### Goal Setting

Written achievable goals will create a path and momentum for a mentee.  Walking
through goal setting with a mentee is one of the first tasks of a mentor.

### Building Confidence

To be clear, another person cannot build confidence in another person.  Another
person cannot destroy the confidence of another.  We only may influence psyche
of another, if another person accepts that influence. Genuine compliments and
praise assist in building a positive relationship that can change another
spirit.  Criticism without tempering has the opposite effect.  People often
learn better by bumping their heads on the wall, as mentors we must allow them
to make mistakes.  When we need to change behavior or their approach a technique
to use is a compliment sandwich.  Pick two things that a mentee is good at, two
items that you appreciate.  The correction is the cheese in the grilled cheese
sandwich, and the praise is the sourdough bread.

What you say, and what you do can influence a mentee.  As a mentor, we have a
position in the relationship, where our influence is enormous.  Positively
approach all interaction, and ask mentees for their opinion.

People build confidence from repetition.  If we have done something before, we
often know we can do it again.  When people lack the grit to do a task, work
with them to find a memory where they completed a job that was similar to their
current endeavor.

### Developing Trust

Without trust, there is no respect, without respect, a relationship can die.
There is no way to have a successful mentoring relationship without trust and
respect.  We communicate to mentees that the relationship is safe, and the only
time we will break confidence is when we are obligated to break that confidence.
When we are forced as mentors to break the confidence of a mentee, then we will
be upfront with them, and let them know it has occurred.

> There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions
put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand
the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.

― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark

There are no dumb questions. Allow people to feel that it is ok, to feel like
you are a n00b.  We were not born with Kubernetes in our blood, we all started
at zero.

Consistency develops trust.  It may seem tripe, but do what you say you are
going to do.  Sincerely apologize if you do not, and be careful with what you
promise.  Under promise and over deliver. Setting Goals

If you have any doubts that goal setting is critical see this Google
[search](https://www.google.com/search?safe=on&q=why+set+goals).  We do not just
set goals, but the goals must be written, with a timeline, measurable, and
reachable.

## Learning Styles

There are three prodominate learning styles; Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic
Learning Styles. People tend to have a primary learning type and a secondary
style. If a mentor and a mentee can identity there perfer learning styles, it
can increase productivity and accelerate the success of the mentoring
relationship.

### Auditory

Auditory learners often talk to themselves. They also may move their lips and
read out loud. They may have difficulty with reading and writing tasks. They
often do better talking to a colleague or a tape recorder and hearing what was
said. To integrate this style into the learning environment:

- Begin new material with a brief explanation of what is coming. Conclude with a
  summary of what has been covered. This is the old adage of "tell them what
  they are going to lean, teach them, and tell them what they have learned."
- Use the Socratic method of lecturing by questioning learners to draw as much
  information from them as possible and then fill in the gaps with you own
  expertise.
- Include auditory activities, such as brainstorming, buzz groups, or Jeopardy.
 Leave plenty of time to debrief activities. This allows them to make
 connections of what they leaned and how it applies to their situation.
- Have the learners verbalize the questions.
- Develop an internal dialogue between yourself and the learners.

### Kinesthetic

Kinesthetic learners do best while touching and moving. It also has two
sub-channels: kinesthetic (movement) and tactile (touch). They tend to lose
concentration if there is little or no external stimulation or movement. When
listening to lectures they may want to take notes for the sake of moving their
hands. When reading, they like to scan the material first, and then focus in on
the details (get the big picture first). They typically use color high lighters
and take notes by drawing pictures, diagrams, or doodling. To integrate this
style into the learning environment:

- Use activities that get the learners up and moving.
- Play music, when appropriate, during activities.
- Use colored markers to emphasize key points on flip charts or white boards.
- Give frequent stretch breaks (brain breaks).
- Provide encourage toys such as Koosh balls and Play-Dough to give them
 something to do with their hands.
- To highlight a point, provide gum, candy, scents, etc. which provides a cross
 link of scent (aroma) to the topic at hand (scent can be a powerful cue).
- Provide high lighters, colored pens and/or pencils.
- Guide learners through a visualization of complex tasks.
- Have them transfer information from the text to another medium such as a
  keyboard or a tablet.

### Visual

Visual learners have two sub-channels—linguistic and spatial. Learners who are
visual-linguistic like to learn through written language, such as reading and
writing tasks. They remember what has been written down, even if they do not
read it more than once. They like to write down directions and pay better
attention to lectures if they watch them. Learners who are visual-spatial
usually have difficulty with the written language and do better with charts,
demonstrations, videos, and other visual materials. They easily visualize faces
and places by using their imagination and seldom get lost in new surroundings.
To integrate this style into the learning environment:

- Use graphs, charts, illustrations, or other visual aids.
- Include outlines, concept maps, agendas, handouts, etc. for reading and
  taking notes.
- Include plenty of content in handouts to reread after the learning session.
- Leave white space in handouts for note-taking.
- Invite questions to help them stay alert in auditory environments.
- Post flip charts to show what will come and what has been presented.
- Emphasize key points to cue when to takes notes.
- Eliminate potential distractions.
- Supplement textual information with illustrations whenever possible.
- Have them draw pictures in the margins.
- Have the learners envision the topic or have them act out the subject matter.

## Time Expectations

We all are busy people, and we have specific expectations about the amount of
time that you will spend mentoring.  One hour per week on slack, as scheduled.
A mentor will attend a one-hour bi-weekly standup and monthly mentor standups.
We appreciate any more time that you can devote to this program, but as we want
to scale this program, we want the time obligations to be reasonable.

## When to ask for help

Ask for help before it is too late.  By the time you think you need to ask for
help, it may already be too late.  With that in mind, reach out to the Pilot
leadership team.

## Summary

TODO - do I need one?
