# Support port ranges in services

* Status: pending
* Version: alpha
* Implementation owner: @m1093782566

## Background & Motivations

There are several applications like SIP apps or RTP which needs a lot of ports to run multiple calls or media streams. Currently there is no way to allow a range in ports in spec. So essentially users may have to do this:

```
- name: sip-udp5060
  containerPort: 5060
  protocol: UDP
- name: sip-udp5061
  containerPort: 5061
  protocol: UDP
  ...
- name: sip-udp5559
  containerPort: 5559
  protocol: UDP
```

Doing above for 500 ports is not pretty. Can we have a way to allow port ranges like 5060-5559?

## Objective

This proposal builds off of earlier requests to [Support port ranges in services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23864) and aims to document all the requirements of supporting port ranges in services.

## Goals

A server side solution.

Support multiple port ranges.

## Non-goal

Target port remapping in ranges.

NodePort on ranges.

Pod port ranges.

## User Cases

* Specifying port ranges in services declarations is mandatory for any VoIP-related application.
* With the standard RTP port range which is 16384-32767. Clients connect on the standard RTP port range with a media server application.
* Needs this change to make TeleStax (an RTC framework) work well in Kubernetes.

## Proposal

This proposal builds off earlier feature requrest to [Support port ranges in services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23864). We aims to implement service port ranges at least for iptables and IPVS modes.

### Service API changes

Create a new filed `PortRange` in `ServicePort`.


```go
type ServiceSpec struct {
  Ports []ServicePort
}

type ServicePort struct {
  // portRange is the port range that are exposed by this service. Service can expose multiple port ranges and each port range should not be overlapped.
  // Service port range does not support target port remapping, which means target port ranges are equal to service port ranges and targetPort should not be specified.
  // Each port range is in the format of `X-Y` and non-negative nuimber X should be <= Y. A port range with single port X can be expressed by `X-X`
  // port should not be specified when portRange is not empty and port should not be fall in any other port ranges.
  // portRange should be not specified for NodePort and ExternalIPs Service.
  // +optional
  PortRange string `json: "portRange,omitempty"`
  ...
}
```

### Service port ranges example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-port-ranges
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  - name: range1
    portRange: 1000-2000
    protocol: UDP
  - name: range2
    portRange: 3000-4000
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: foo
```

### Kube-proxy implementation limitations

NodePort and ExternalIPs Services don't support port ranges since kube-proxy will hold local ports open for these services(nodeport and "external" IP happens to be an IP that is local to this machine). It's challenging to keep some huge port ranges open on host.

Target port remapping is not supported since both iptables and ipvs does not do port translations in the mean time of doing port ranges.

#### iptables mode

iptables `multiport` modules support specifying multiple ports in a single line. Suppose service VIP is `1.2.3.4` and port ranges are `1000-2000` and `3000-4000`, then iptables rules will looks like

```shell
iptables -A KUBE-SERVICES -d 1.2.3.4/32 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 1000:2000,3000:4000 -j KUBE-SVC-FOO
```

#### ipvs mode

IPVS + FWMARK can do port ranges. For example,

```shell
iptables -A PREROUTNG -t mangle -d 172.16.52.57 -p tcp --dport 1000:2000,3000:4000 -j MARK --set-mark 1

ipvsadm -A -f 1 -s rr
ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 172.16.52.60 -m
ipvsadm -a -f 1 -r 172.16.52.61 -m
```

Create a fwmark bit range [0-31], for stipulating the IPVS fwmark value range. Itâ€™s configurable and should not collison with masqBit and DropBit. By default, it's [0-13] (suppose masqBit is 14 and DropBit is 15), which means we can generate at most 8K fwmark values and cover 8K port ranges.

Given VIP 1.2.3.4 and port ranges `1000:2000` and `3000:4000`. Kube-proxy will generate a unique fwmark value in the range of [1-8191], say F1. If the packet needs to be masqueraded, then `F1 = F1 OR 0x4000`. If the packets will be dropped later, then `F1 = F1 OR 0x8000`. Kube-proxy set F1 to the FWMARK field (will be created later) of IPVS virtual server and apply it to kernel.

Netfilter will test if the packet should be masqueraded by bit testing `F1 & 0X4000 == 0X4000` in POSTROUTING chain. Similar thing will happen for checking if the packet should be dropped.
