# Overview

We describe a proposal for retrieving component related configurations (componentconfigs and otherwise) that govern the behavior of any one of the Kubernetes (K8s) components.

We propose several important changes:

* adding new authenticated protected path to a component api:
    * `/configs`
    * Discussions to be held with SIG-Auth individuals about making such a path secured, but we will invoke that similar discussions around metrics have taken place.
* helping complete the migration of flags to things that belong into componentconfigs

## Background

The document is built from SIG-Scale and PR discussions. Here we document the results of these and build the proposal of what changes should/will be made to K8s.

## Motivation

By necessity Kubernetes is a stateful thing made up of components who have been configured in a particular way. Currently the K8s code base, as 11/2016, does not support a way nor means by which to query for the set of configurations that led to the current state of any component. As a consequence it is extremely difficult to debug the current state of a K8s cluster, especially when original configurations have been lost, or are simply not available.

## Design

Components will have either a path indicated by annotations that can point to how to retrieve the configurations or through a well known component api path, as discussed below.

### Component API Changes

Components (like kubelet) have endpoints that can be altered to include an endpoint such as

```
 /configs 
```

similar to /metrics endpoints for K8s components and likely to be authenticated in much the same way.

By way of an `HTTP GET` the output would be:

```
{
    "kind": "configuration-list",
    "metadata": {
        "component": "kubelet",
        "id": "818B908B-D053-CB11-BC8B-EEA826EBA090",
        "timeStamp": "2016-09-13T14:47:35+00:00",
    },
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "componentconfigs",
            "metadata": {
                "version": "v1",
                ...
            },
            "list": [
                cloud-provider": "aws",
                "aGroupName": {
                    "aKey": "aValue",
                    ...
                },
                ...
            ]        
        },
        {
            "type": "componentconfigs",
            "metadata": {
                "version": "v2",
                ...
            },
            "list": [
                cloud-provider": "aws",
                "bGroupName": {
                    "bKey": "bValue",
                    ...
                },
                ...
            ]        
        },
        {
            "type": "additionalconfigs",
            "list": [
                "bKey": "bValue",
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Those componentconfigs that are to be associated with a particular component will be annotated so as to be labeled for collection and served by the proposed endpoint.

## Alternatives and Further Discussions

Here we mention points of contentions and alternatives as we make progress in the proposal.

* Security/Auth has been brought up as a point that strongly affects the proposed endpoint. Ideas around component endpoints and auth have been discussed for `/metrics` and it has been noted that SIG-Auth may be assigned the `/configs` endpoint to ensure auth is handled correctly.
* The addition of an api change/addition to APIServer has been discussed, and for reasons of security it was agreed to be left out as a potential addition in the future.
* The addition of kubectl/kubeadmin interactions has also been scrapped for reasons of security with possible addition in the future, but do not gain us much for our present motivations.
* It has been agreed that extracting configs from componentconfigs is the way forward.

## Future Work

* Collect all possible configurations that could be extracted. Determine which configurations belong under the compomentconfig object and which do not and have an understanding why.

* In the future configurations will be versioned, so that you can get specific
version of a given type

    ```
    /configs/componentconfigs/v1/
    ```

    where the configurations list will contain only that componentconfig whose version is v1. Note, lack of version specified could result in all versions exposed or only the latest, a choice should be made where the recommendation is for all.

    It has also been suggested that we could potentially query for a configuration. It is suggested that this be done by the following path

    ```
    /configs/componentconfigs/v1/{name}
    ```

    In addition

    ```
    /configs/additionalconfigs/{name}
    ```

    If the configuration is a top level group name, we could specify the group we wish to retrieve as

    ```
    /configs/componentconfigs/v1/{groupName}
    ```

    consequently we could query for its metadata also, finally given that we want a very specific config from this group we would make a request

    ```
    /configs/componentconfigs/v1/{groupName}/{name}
    ```
