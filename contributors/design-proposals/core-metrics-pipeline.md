## Introduction

### Background
The [Monitoring Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/monitoring_architecture.md) proposal contains a blueprint for a set of metrics referred to as "Core Metrics".  The purpose of this proposal is to specify what those metrics are, and how they will be collected on the node.

cAdvisor is an open source container monitoring solution which only monitors containers, and has no concept of k8s constructs like pods or volumes.  Kubernetes vendors cAdvisor into its codebase, and uses cAdvisor as a library with functions that enable it to collect metrics on containers.  The kubelet can then combine container-level metrics from cAdvisor with the kubelet's knowledge of k8s constructs like pods to produce the kubelet Summary statistics, which provides metrics for use by the kubelet, or by users through the Summary API.  cAdvisor works by collecting metrics at an interval (10 seconds), and the kubelet then simply queries these cached metrics whenever it has a need for them.

Currently, cAdvisor collects a large number of metrics related to system and container performance. However, only some of these metrics are consumed by the kubelet summary API, and many are not used.  The kubelet summary API is published to the kubelet summary API endpoint.  Some of the metrics provided by the summary API are consumed internally, but most are not used internally.

### Motivations

The [Monitoring Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/monitoring_architecture.md) proposal explains why a separate monitoring pipeline is required.

cAdvisor is structured to collect metrics on an interval, which is appropriate for a stand-alone metrics collector.  However, many functions in the kubelet are latency-sensitive (eviction, for example), and would benifit from a more "On-Demand" metrics collection design.

### Proposal

I propose to use this set of core metrics, collected by the kubelet, and used solely by internal kubernetes components.

### Non Goals

Everything covered in the [Monitoring Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/monitoring_architecture.md) design doc.  This includes the third party metrics pipeline, and the methods by which the metrics found in this proposal are provided to other kubernetes components.

Integration with CRI will not be covered in this proposal.  In future proposals, integrating with CRI may provide a better abstraction of information required by the core metrics pipeline to collect metrics.

## Design

This design covers only the internal Core Metrics Pipeline.

High level requirements for the design are as follows:
 - Do not break existing users.  We should continue to provide the full summary API by default.
 - The kubelet collects the minimum possible number of metrics for complete portable kubernetes functionalities.
 - Metrics can be fetched "On Demand", giving the kubelet more up-to-date stats.

Metrics requirements, based on kubernetes component needs, are as follows:
 - Kubelet
  - Node-level capacity and availability metrics for Disk and Memory
  - Pod-level usage metrics for Disk and Memory
 - Scheduler
  - Node-level capacity and availability metrics for Disk, CPU, and Memory
  - Pod-level usage metrics for Disk, CPU, and Memory
  - Container-level usage metrics for Disk, CPU, and Memory
 - Horizontal-Pod-Autoscaler (HPA)
  - Node-level capacity and availability metrics for CPU and Memory
  - Pod-level usage metrics for CPU and Memory
 - Master metrics API
  -

More details on how I intend to achieve these high level goals can be found in the Implementation Plan.

In order to continue to provide the full summary API, eventually a stand-alone version of cAdvisor will need to publish these metrics.

This Core Metrics API will be versioned to account for version-skew between kubernetes components.

This proposal purposefully omits many metrics that may eventually become core metrics.  This is by design.  Once metrics are needed for an internal use case, they can be added to the core metrics API.

### Proposed Core Metrics API:

An important difference between the current summary api and the proposed core metrics api is that per-pod stats in the core metrics api contain only usage data, and not capacity-related statistics.  This is more accurate since a pod's resource capacity is really defined by its "requests" and "limits", and it is a better reflection of how the kubelet uses the data.  The kubelet finds which resources are constrained using node-level capacity and availability data, and then chooses which pods to take action on based on the pod's usage of the constrained resource.  If neccessary, capacity for resources a pod consumes can still be correlated with node-level resources using this format of stats.

```go
// CoreStats is a top-level container for holding NodeStats and PodStats.

### Core Machine Info:

In addition to providing metrics, cAdvisor also provides machine info.  While it is not neccessary to use this structure for reporting Machine Info, the following contains all of the information provided to the kubelet by cAdvisor, generally used at startup.

```go
type MachineInfo struct {  
  // MachineID reported by the node. For unique machine identification  
  // in the cluster this field is prefered. Learn more from man(5)  
  // machine-id: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html  
  MachineID string `json:"machineID" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=machineID"`  
  // SystemUUID reported by the node. For unique machine identification  
  // MachineID is prefered. This field is specific to Red Hat hosts  
  // https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html/RHSM/getting-system-uuid.html  
  SystemUUID string `json:"systemUUID" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=systemUUID"`  
  // Boot ID reported by the node.  
  BootID string `json:"bootID" protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=bootID"`  
  // Kernel Version reported by the node from 'uname -r' (e.g. 3.16.0-0.bpo.4-amd64).  
  KernelVersion string `json:"kernelVersion" protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=kernelVersion"`  
  // OS Image reported by the node from /etc/os-release (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy)).  
  OSImage string `json:"osImage" protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=osImage"`  
  // Capacity represents the total resources of a node.  
  // More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes#capacity for more details.  
  // +optional  
  // ContainerRuntime Version reported by the node through runtime remote API (e.g. docker://1.5.0).  
  ContainerRuntimeVersion string `json:"containerRuntimeVersion" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=containerRuntimeVersion"`  
  // Cloud provider the machine belongs to.  
  CloudProvider CloudProvider `json:"cloud_provider"`  
  // ID of cloud instance (e.g. instance-1) given to it by the cloud provider.  
  InstanceID InstanceID `json:"instance_id"`  
}  

type CloudProvider string  

const (  
  GCE             CloudProvider = "GCE"  
  AWS                           = "AWS"  
  Azure                         = "Azure"  
  Baremetal                     = "Baremetal"  
  UnknownProvider               = "Unknown"  
)
```

## Implementation Plan

I will create a separate endpoint TBD to publish this set of core metrics.
I will modify volume stats collection so that it relies on this code.  
I will modify the structure of stats collection code to be "On-Demand".   

Tenative future work, not included in this proposal:  
Obtain all runtime-specific information needed to collect metrics from the CRI.   
Modify cAdvisor to be "stand alone", and run in a seperate binary from the kubelet.  It will consume the above metadata API, and provide the summary API.  
The kubelet no longer provides the summary API, and starts cAdvisor stand-alone by default.  Include flag to not start cAdvisor.  

## Rollout Plan

TBD
