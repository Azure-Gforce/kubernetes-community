# ConfigMaps as environment variables

## Goal

Populating environment variables of a container from an entire ConfigMap.

## Design Points

A container can specify a set of existing ConfigMaps to populate environment variables.

There needs to be an easy way to isolate the variables introduced by a given
ConfigMap. The contents of a ConfigMap may not be known in advance and it may
be generated by someone or something else. Services may provide binding
information via a ConfigMap. If you have a common service with multiple
instances like a Message Queue or Database, there needs to be a way to
uniquely identify and prevent collision when combining these ConfigMaps.

## Proposed Design

Containers can specify a set of sources that are consumed as environment
variables. One such source is a ConfigMap.
Each key defined in the ConfigMap's `Data` object must be a "C" identifier. If
an invalid key is present, the container will fail to start.

Environment variables are currently defined by services or the `Env` object in
a container, where the `Env` takes precedence.  The introduction of ConfigMaps
adds a third possibility. To prevent any change in behavior, the `Env` object
will still override any environment variable introduced by a ConfigMap.
A ConfigMap is allowed to override variables defined by services.  Variable
references defined by an `EnvVar` struct can be resolved by values defined in
other `EnvVar`s or those introduced by ConfigMaps and services.

To prevent collisions amongst multiple ConfigMaps, each defined ConfigMap can
have an optional associated prefix that is prepended to each key in the
ConfigMap.  Prefixes must be a "C" identifier.

### Kubectl updates

The describe command will display the configmap name that have been defined as
part of the environment variable section including the optional prefix when
defined.

### API Resource

A new `EnvFromSource` type containing a `ConfigMapRef` will be added to the
`Container` struct.

```go
// EnvFromSource represents the source of a set of ConfigMaps
type EnvFromSource struct {
  // A string to place in front of every key. Must be a C_IDENTIFIER.
  // +optional
  Prefix string `json:"prefix,omitempty"`
  // The ConfigMap to select from
  ConfigMapRef *LocalObjectReference `json:"configMapRef,omitempty"`
}

type Container struct {
  // List of sources to populate environment variables in the container.
  // The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. An invalid key
  // will prevent the container from starting.
  // All env values will take precedence over any listed source.
  // Cannot be updated.
  // +optional
  EnvFrom []EnvFromSource `json:"envFrom,omitempty"`
}
```

### Examples

### Consuming `ConfigMap` as Environment Variables

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: etcd-env-config
data:
  number_of_members: "1"
  initial_cluster_state: new
  initial_cluster_token: DUMMY_ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_TOKEN
  discovery_token: DUMMY_ETCD_DISCOVERY_TOKEN
  discovery_url: http://etcd_discovery:2379
  etcdctl_peers: http://etcd:2379
  duplicate_key: FROM_CONFIG_MAP
  REPLACE_ME: "a value"
```

This pod consumes the entire `ConfigMap` as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: config-env-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: etcd
    image: openshift/etcd-20-centos7
    ports:
    - containerPort: 2379
      protocol: TCP
    - containerPort: 2380
      protocol: TCP
    env:
    - Name: duplicate_key
      Value: FROM_ENV
    - Name: expansion
      Value: ${REPLACE_ME}
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: etcd-env-config
```

The resulting environment variables will be:

```
number_of_members="1"
initial_cluster_state="new"
initial_cluster_token="DUMMY_ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_TOKEN"
discovery_token="DUMMY_ETCD_DISCOVERY_TOKEN"
discovery_url="http://etcd_discovery:2379"
etcdctl_peers="http://etcd:2379"
duplicate_key="FROM_ENV"
expansion="a value"
REPLACE_ME="a value"
```

### Consuming multiple `ConfigMap` as Environment Variables

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: env-config
data:
  key1: a
  key2: b
```

This pod consumes the entire `ConfigMap` as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: config-env-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: etcd
    image: openshift/etcd-20-centos7
    ports:
    - containerPort: 2379
      protocol: TCP
    - containerPort: 2380
      protocol: TCP
    envFrom:
    - prefix: cm1_
      configMapRef:
        name: env-config
    - prefix: cm2_
      configMapRef:
        name: env-config
```

The resulting environment variables will be:

```
cm1_key1="a"
cm1_key2="b"
cm2_key1="a"
cm2_key2="b"
```

### Future

Add similar support for Secrets.
