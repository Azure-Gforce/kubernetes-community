Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with Arbitary Metrics
===============================================

The current Horizontal Pod Autoscaler object only has support for CPU as
a percentage of requested CPU.  While this is certainly a common case, one
of the most frequently sought-after features for the HPA is the ability to
scale on different metrics (be they custom metrics, memory, etc).

The current HPA controller supports targeting "custom" metrics (metrics
with a name prefixed with "custom/") via an annotation, but this is
suboptimal for a number of reasons: it does not allow for arbitrary
"non-custom" metrics (e.g. memory), it does not allow for metrics
describing other objects (e.g. scaling based on metrics on services), and
carries the various downsides of annotations (not be typed/validated,
being hard for a user to hand-construct, etc).

Object Design
-------------

### Requirements ###

This proposal describes a new version of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
object with the following requirements kept in mind:

1. The HPA should continue to support scaling based on percentage of CPU
   request

2. The HPA should support scaling on arbitrary metrics associated with
   pods

3. The HPA should support scaling on arbitrary metrics associated with
   other Kubernetes objects in the same namespace as the HPA (and the
   namespace itself)

4. The HPA should make scaling on multiple metrics in a single HPA
   possible and explicit (splitting metrics across multiple HPAs leads to
   the possibility of fighting between HPAs)

### Example ###

In this example, we scale based on the `hits-per-second` value recorded as
describing a service in our namespace, plus the CPU usage of the pods in
the ReplicationController being autoscaled.

```yaml
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2alpha1
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: ReplicationController
    name: WebFrontend
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      targetAverageUtilization: 80
  - type: Object
    object:
      target:
        kind: Service
        name: Frontend
      metricName: hits-per-second
      targetValue: 1k
```

### Alternatives and Future Considerations ###

Since the new design mirrors volume plugins (and similar APIs), it makes
it relatively easy to introduce new fields in a backwards-compatible way:
we simply introduce a new field in `MetricSpec` as a new "metric type".

#### External ####

It was discussed adding a source type of `External` which has a single
opaque metric field and target value.  This would indicate that the HPA
was under control of an external autoscaler, which would allow external
autoscalers to be present in the cluster while still indicating to tooling
that autoscaling is taking place.

However, since this raises a number of questions and complications about
interaction with the existing autoscaler, it was decided to exclude this
feature.  We may reconsider in the future.

#### Limit Percentages ####

In cluster environments where request is automatically set for scheduling
purposes, it is advantageous to be able to autoscale on percentage of
limit for resource metrics.  We may wish to consider adding
a `targetPercentageOfLimit` to the `ResourceMetricSource` type.

#### Referring to the current Namespace ####

It is beneficial to be able to refer to a metric on the current namespace,
similarly to the `ObjectMetricSource` source type, but without an explicit
name.  Because of the similarity to `ObjectMetricSource`, it may simply be
sufficient to allow specificying a `kind` of "Namespace" without a name.
Alternatively, a similar source type to `PodsMetricSource` could be used.

#### Calculating Final Desired Replica Count ####

Since we have multiple replica counts (one from each metric), we must have
a way to aggregated them into a final replica count.  In this iteration of
the proposal, we simply take the maximum of all the computed replica
counts.  However, in certain cases, it could be useful to allow the user
to specify that they wanted the minimum or average instead.

In the general case, maximum should be sufficient, but if the need arises,
it should be fairly easy to add such a field in.

Mechanical Concerns
-------------------

The HPA will derive metrics from two sources: resource metrics (i.e. CPU
request percentage) will come from the
[master metrics API](resource-metrics-api.md), while other metrics will
come from the custom metrics API (currently proposed as #34586), which is
an adapter API which sources metrics directly from the monitoring
pipeline.

Conversion and Defaulting
-------------------------

### Conversion ###

According the deprecation policy, objects must be round-trippable through
all supported versions.  Therefore, two alpha annotations will be
introduced: `autoscaling.alpha.kubernetes.io/metrics` and
`autoscaling.alpha.kubernetes.io/current-metrics`.  These will correspond
roughly to the `Metrics` and `CurrentMetrics` fields in `v2alpha1`.

In the case of conversion from `v1` to `v2alpha`, the value of the
appropriate CPU field will be read, converted into a `MetricSpec` of type
`Resource`, and then appended to the list of existing `MetricSpec`s to
form the slice for the `Metrics` field in `v2alpha1` (and similarly for
`MetricStatus`es and `CurrentMetrics`).

In the opposite direction, the list of metrics will be searched for
a field of type `Resource` with a name of `api.ResourceCPU` and a set
utilization percentage.  This will be removed from the list and used to
populate the CPU field in `v1`, while the remainder of the `MetricSpec`s
(and `MetricStatus`es) will be placed into the appropriate annotation.

#### Example ####

Consider the example object described above.  It would appear in
`autoscaling/v1` as

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.alpha.kubernetes.io/metrics: "[{\"type\": \"Object\", \"object\": {\"target\": {\"kind\": \"Service\", \"name\": \"Frontend\"}, \"metricName\": \"hits-per-second\", \"targetValue\": \"1k\"}}]"
    object:
      target:
        kind: Service
        name: Frontend
      metricName: hits-per-second
      targetValue: 1k
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: ReplicationController
    name: WebFrontend
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  TargetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

### Defaulting ###

Currently, in `autoscaling/v1`, no API-level defaulting is done -- if the
user creates an HPA without a set CPU autoscaling level, the controller
will look at whether or not the custom metrics annotation is set.  If it
is, the controller will scale on custom metrics, and if not, it will use
a "default" value built in to the controller.

Since `v2alpha1` has field-level "custom" metrics, we no longer need to
rely on this "implicit" defaulting.  If a user creates an empty HPA, it
will be populated with an explicit default CPU policy.  This makes it
clearer to the end user how their HPA is scaling, and makes the jump from
"default HPA" to "customized HPA" easier.
