# Program Manager

## Role Description

### About

This document defines and outlines the Program Manager role within
the Kubernetes community in correspondence with the existing [description of SIG
Governance](/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md#program-manager). 
Special Interest Groups (SIGs) can use this to onboard new Program Managers and 
clarify expectations associated with the role.

### Abstract
Kubernetes SIGs may choose to implement the Program Manager role as part of their 
[governance model](https://git.k8s.io/community/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md#roles)
and document the role in their SIG charters. SIG Chairs choose program managers and 
endow them with the same set of permissions. Based on overall SIG size, 1-3 program 
managers are recommended to support the SIG's program and process-related efforts.  

Program Managers are generally responsible for driving process development and improvements 
related to SIG communications, delegation of work, and alignment—both within their SIG as 
well as between their SIG and other groups. The overall aim is to support the SIG in 
delivering outcomes effectively while reducing risk.

To optimise their success, Kubernetes Program Managers should collaborate with other SIG 
leadership as early and often as possible when ideating/developing new processes or suggesting 
improvements. Overly prescriptive, cookie-cutter approaches tend not to gain traction in 
Kubernetes—those developed in a silo even less so. Focus on delivering value based on 
expressed needs.

Program Managers are responsible for coordinating the success of their SIGs’ delivery 
workflow and related practices, including cross-SIG coordination and communication.
- They maintain an open mind in order to gain a high level of trust with other members of 
the SIG.
- They are willing to observe current processes and development practices and listen to 
SIG leads and contributors before making any recommendations. 
- They're involved in the day-to-day workings of the SIG—attending (or in some cases hosting) meetings, following 
discussions on Slack, learning about the priorities and technical responsibilities and plans 
for the group. This heightens their ability to make relevant suggestions and decisions.

Examples of Program Management leadership within a SIG include:
- Continuously noting delivery obstacles, waste, duplication of effort, and siloing, and 
raising these risks to the SIG for discussion and remediation.
- Setting up and launching processes aimed at driving delivery effectiveness, such as issue 
triage, roadmapping/North Star vision creation, backlog refinement, and KEP planning.
- Regularly evaluating established processes to ensure they’re working, by asking the group 
for feedback and measuring impact with metrics.
- Setting up programs related to cross-SIG delivery of KEPs, and dependency management.
- Coaching/mentoring other SIG leads and contributors to facilitate processes, meetings, and 
activities that drive achievement of delivery outcomes.
- Guiding their SIG to adopt prioritisation frameworks that support delivery of the highest-
value, highest-impact work.
- Ensuring their SIG is following established practices in Kubernetes, from adherence to release
deadlines to enforcing the Code of Conduct.
- Advising the SIG on tooling that supports delivery effectiveness and smooth workflows, such as
GitHub project boards and creative use of GitHub Issues to track work.
- Designing lightweight communication structures that reinforce timely responsiveness to deadlines 
and external requests; includes regular drumbeats to report progress to the community.
- Prioritising contributor experience in order to drive delegation of work and reduce risk. 
Related activities might include refining SIG onboarding for different skillsets, creating “career 
ladders,” and designing work packages that engaged contributors can drive via small teams.

The common skill set of Program Managers covers three areas:

- **Leadership** – You can coach team members to reach their goals, guiding them to solutions 
that balance their personal interests with the needs of the SIG and project. You look for ways to 
include newcomers and make sure they have access to the context that will help them be successful.
You seek compromise to mitigate conflict and drive the group to focus on outcomes.
- **Objectivity** – You take actions and propose ideas based on evidence and facts, challenging 
your own assumptions. You listen closely, seek second and third opinions to weigh different 
perspectives, and promote the value of fairness.
- **Strategic thinking** – You design approaches that incorporate short-term wins and tactics to 
drive long-term growth and innovation. You know how to take complex problems and break them down into 
increments.
