***1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?***
* Karen Bradshaw, Tim Bannister, and Taylor Dolezal stepped down as SIG Docs Tech Leads. Kat Cosgrove and Xander Grzywinski were appointed as new Tech Leads.
* While not a success, SIG Docs took 2024 to explore options around translation tooling for localizations, however, staffing changes meant it couldn't be prioritized in time. The `localization` subproject will own this exploration for 2025 and beyond.

***2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?***
* We continue to require help with the `kubernetes-blog` subproject. While we have separated tasks based on needs for release blogs and general blog posts, our blog team still needs more staff.
* The `reference-docs` subproject is slowly being revived, with some refactoring planned to bring on more contributors. Kat Cosgrove and Xander Grzywinski, our new Tech Leads, will be elevated to OWNERS.
* As part of our [annual updation of the OWNERS file](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/49273), we found that two of our localisations are at risk due to there being only one active approver/reviewer. SIG leads [have requested](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0191RDKHU1/p1739338503630329?thread_ts=1735797874.143339&cid=C0191RDKHU1) the localisation subproject leads to reach out to the respective localisations and also, feature this as a discussion item in the upcoming localisation meeting to understand how to better support them.

***3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2024 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?***
