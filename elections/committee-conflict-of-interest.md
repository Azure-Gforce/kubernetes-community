# Committee Conflicts of Interest

As project committees have unique charters, there is a possibility
for a conflict of interest to arise. While multiple scenarios may
be possible now or in the future, one known example of such conflict
of interest is where a member of the Code of Conduct Committee is
elected to the Steering Committee.

Such conflict will be resolved by the applicable Election Committee
reaching out to the newly-elected member and facilitating a decision
regarding on which committee the individual will continue. The
committee where that individual vacated their seat will fill that
vacancy as per existing election or committee vacancy rules.
