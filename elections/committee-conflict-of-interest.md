# Committee Conflicts of Interest

At time of writing, the only known conflict of interest for serving on
committees in the Kubernetes Community exists with the
[Steering Committee](/committee-steering/README.md) and
the [Code of Conduct Committee](/committee-code-of-conduct/README.md).

**_Kubernetes Community members cannot serve on both committees simultaneously._**

Upon the creation of a potential conflict (after the candidate is nominated for a position that would conflict, and before the conclusion of the election), an uninvolved member of Steering will reach out to them to determine which committee they want to continue with in the event that they are elected.  If the active election is for the Steering Committee, the Election Officers will be informed of this decision, and can request that Steering contact the candidate.
the newly elected Steering Committee member and ask which committee they intend
to continue with.

The committee where that individual vacated their seat will fill that vacancy
per existing election or committee vacancy rules.
