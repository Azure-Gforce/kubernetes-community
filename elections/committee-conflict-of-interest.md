# Committee Conflicts of Interest

At time of writing, the only known conflict of interest for serving on
committees in the Kubernetes Community exists with the
[Steering Committee](/committee-steering/README.md) and
the [Code of Conduct Committee](/committee-code-of-conduct/README.md).

**_Kubernetes Community members cannot serve on both committees simultaneously._**

Upon appointment, the (Steering Committee) election committee will reach out to
the newly elected Steering Committee member and ask which committee they intend
to continue with.

The committee where that individual vacated their seat will fill that vacancy
per existing election or committee vacancy rules.
