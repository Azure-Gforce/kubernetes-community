# Committee Conflicts of Interest

## Steering Committee and Code of Conduct Committee

At time of writing, the only known conflict of interest for serving on
committees in the Kubernetes Community exists with the
[Steering Committee](/committee-steering/README.md) and
the [Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC)](/committee-code-of-conduct/README.md).

**_Kubernetes Community members cannot serve on both committees simultaneously._**

This conflict may arise in the following scenarios:

- A standing Steering Committee member has accepted a nomination to serve on
  the Code of Conduct Committee
- A standing CoCC member has elected to run for a seat on the Steering
  Committee
- A Kubernetes Community member has been nominated for candidacy for both
  committees

Given the uniqueness of the respective committee charters, their memberships'
position in the community, and the difference in how these committees need to
adjudicate on community matters, _candidates must be able to declare their
preference in which committee they would like to serve on, if elected_.

After the candidate is nominated for a position that would conflict and before
the conclusion of the first of the two elections to complete, a non-conflicted
Election Officer or in the event that a Steering Committee election is not
active, a non-conflicted Steering Committee member will reach out to the
candidate to determine which committee they want to continue with in the event
that they are elected.

This process should occur as soon as possible after a potential conflict has
been identified.

If the candidate is elected in the first election to conclude and that
appointment matches their preference, the candidate will be withdrawn from the
remaining open election.

If applicable, the committee where that individual vacated their seat will fill
that vacancy per existing election or committee vacancy rules.

In the event that multiple candidates trigger this conflict in an election
cycle, the two (2) affected candidates receiving the most votes will have their
preference honored. In the event that the first election to conclude has only
two seats under consideration, only the affected candidate with the most votes
will have their preference honored.
