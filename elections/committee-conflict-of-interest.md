# Committee Conflicts of Interest

At time of writing, the only known conflict of interest for serving on
committees in the Kubernetes Community exists with the
[Steering Committee](/committee-steering/README.md) and
the [Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC)](/committee-code-of-conduct/README.md).

## Steering Committee and Code of Conduct Committee

**_Kubernetes Community members cannot serve on both committees simultaneously._**

This conflict may arise in the following scenarios:

- A standing Steering Committee member has accepted a nomination to serve on
  the Code of Conduct Committee
- A standing CoCC member has elected to run for a seat on the Steering
  Committee
- A Kubernetes Community member has been nominated for candidacy for both
  committees

There are several factors under consideration when formulating a reasonable
process for resolving this conflict of interest:

- The distinctness of the Steering and CoCC charters, not limited to how these
  committees need to adjudicate on community matters
- The Kubernetes Community's expectation of commitment in its committee members
  for duration of their terms
- Continuity of committees and the duties they discharge
- Undue burden on existing committee members to balance workload through
  committee membership transitions, not limited to onboarding/offboarding
- Undue burden on Election Officers in supporting overlapping elections with
  the potential to generate conflicts
- Minimization of conflict of interest edge cases not otherwise described by
  this document

With these considerations in mind, the following rules exist to prevent or
resolve membership conflicts of interest between Steering and the CoCC:

<!-- TODO(committee-coi): Reflect this list in each committee's "Eligibility for candidacy" section -->

- Loss of committee member that occurs due to this conflict of interest will
  be resolved per existing election or committee vacancy rules
- Candidates who are nominated for a seat on both Steering and CoCC within the
  same 12-month period must:
  - (if elected) accept a seat on the committee whose election concludes first
  - be withdrawn from candidacy in second election to conclude
- Standing Steering or CoCC members must have served on their committee for a
  period of twelve (12) months to be considered eligible for candidacy in the
  other committee's election
- Kubernetes Community members who have recently vacated a seat on either
  Steering or CoCC will be ineligible for candidacy for a period of three (3)
  months

Should this conflict of interest arise in a manner that cannot be resolved by
these rules, a non-conflicted Election Officer or, in the event that a Steering
Committee election is not active, a non-conflicted Steering Committee member
will reach out to the candidate to discuss resolution.
